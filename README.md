# Python_Challenge
The python-programming challenges found here are examples of data analysis work involving real-world situations 
 
 # Expectations
 
 To create a main script with a functional code that outputs a series of accurate results onto a separate text file under the Analysis folder. 
 
# Banking Analysis

First I created a python script that analyzed the financial records for a company. My code analyzed each of the following: 

The total number of months included in the dataset


The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes


The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

# Election Analysis

Next, I created a python script that analyzed election data in a rural town to update its voting counting process. My code analyzes each of the following: 
The total number of votes cast


A complete list of candidates who received votes


The percentage of votes each candidate won


The total number of votes each candidate won


The winner of the election based on popular vote.
